> DESCRIPTION
>
>        The  iostat  command  is used for monitoring system input/output device
>        loading by observing the time the devices are  active  in  relation  to
>        their average transfer rates. The iostat command generates reports that
>        can be used to  change  system  configuration  to  better  balance  the
>        input/output load between physical disks.
> 
>        The  first  report  generated by the iostat command provides statistics
>        concerning the time since the system was booted, unless the  -y  option
>        is  used (in this case, this first report is omitted).  Each subsequent
>        report covers the time since the previous report.  All  statistics  are
>        reported  each time the iostat command is run. The report consists of a
>        CPU header row followed by a row of CPU statistics.  On  multiprocessor
>        systems,  CPU  statistics  are calculated system-wide as averages among
>        all processors. A device header row is displayed followed by a line  of
>        statistics for each device that is configured.
> 
>        The  interval parameter specifies the amount of time in seconds between
>        each report. The count parameter can be specified in  conjunction  with
>        the  interval parameter. If the count parameter is specified, the value
>        of count determines the number of reports generated at interval seconds
>        apart. If the interval parameter is specified without the count parame-
>        ter, the iostat command generates reports continuously.
> 
> 
> REPORTS
> 
>        The iostat command generates two types of reports, the CPU  Utilization
>        report and the Device Utilization report.

       CPU Utilization Report
              The first report generated by the iostat command is the CPU Uti-
              lization Report. For multiprocessor systems, the CPU values  are
              global  averages  among all processors.  The report has the fol-
              lowing format:

              %user
                     Show the percentage  of  CPU  utilization  that  occurred
                     while executing at the user level (application).

              %nice
                     Show  the  percentage  of  CPU  utilization that occurred
                     while executing at the user level with nice priority.

              %system
                     Show the percentage  of  CPU  utilization  that  occurred
                     while executing at the system level (kernel).

              %iowait
                     Show  the  percentage  of  time that the CPU or CPUs were
                     idle during which the system had an outstanding disk  I/O
                     request.

              %steal
                     Show  the percentage of time spent in involuntary wait by
                     the virtual CPU or CPUs while the hypervisor was  servic-
                     ing another virtual processor.

              %idle
                     Show  the  percentage  of  time that the CPU or CPUs were
                     idle and the system did not have an outstanding disk  I/O
                     request.

       Device Utilization Report
              The  second report generated by the iostat command is the Device
              Utilization Report. The device report provides statistics  on  a
              per physical device or partition basis. Block devices and parti-
              tions for which statistics are to be displayed may be entered on
              the  command  line.  If no device nor partition is entered, then
              statistics are displayed for every device used  by  the  system,
              and  providing  that the kernel maintains statistics for it.  If
              the ALL keyword is given on the command  line,  then  statistics
              are  displayed for every device defined by the system, including
              those that have never been used.  Transfer rates are shown in 1K
              blocks  by default, unless the environment variable POSIXLY_COR-
              RECT is set, in which case 512-byte blocks are used.  The report
              may show the following fields, depending on the flags used:

              Device:
                     This  column  gives  the  device  (or  partition) name as
                     listed in the /dev directory.

              tps
                     Indicate the number of transfers  per  second  that  were
                     issued to the device. A transfer is an I/O request to the
                     device. Multiple logical requests can be combined into  a
                     single  I/O request to the device. A transfer is of inde-
                     terminate size.

              Blk_read/s (kB_read/s, MB_read/s)
                     Indicate  the  amount  of  data  read  from  the   device
                     expressed  in  a  number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes)
                     per second. Blocks are equivalent to sectors  and  there-
                     fore have a size of 512 bytes.

              Blk_wrtn/s (kB_wrtn/s, MB_wrtn/s)
                     Indicate  the  amount  of  data  written  to  the  device
                     expressed in a number of  blocks  (kilobytes,  megabytes)
                     per second.

              Blk_read (kB_read, MB_read)
                     The total number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) read.

              Blk_wrtn (kB_wrtn, MB_wrtn)
                     The  total  number of blocks (kilobytes, megabytes) writ-
                     ten.

              rrqm/s
                     The number of read requests merged per second  that  were
                     queued to the device.

              wrqm/s
                     The  number of write requests merged per second that were
                     queued to the device.

              r/s
                     The number (after merges) of read requests completed  per
                     second for the device.

              w/s
                     The number (after merges) of write requests completed per
                     second for the device.

              rsec/s (rkB/s, rMB/s)
                     The number of sectors (kilobytes,  megabytes)  read  from
                     the device per second.

              wsec/s (wkB/s, wMB/s)
                     The  number  of sectors (kilobytes, megabytes) written to
                     the device per second.

              avgrq-sz
                     The average size (in sectors) of the requests  that  were
                     issued to the device.

              avgqu-sz
                     The average queue length of the requests that were issued
                     to the device.

              await
                     The average  time  (in  milliseconds)  for  I/O  requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the time
                     spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servic-
                     ing them.

              r_await
                     The  average  time  (in  milliseconds)  for read requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the time
                     spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servic-
                     ing them.

              w_await
                     The average time (in  milliseconds)  for  write  requests
                     issued to the device to be served. This includes the time
                     spent by the requests in queue and the time spent servic-
                     ing them.

              svctm
                     The  average  service  time  (in  milliseconds)  for  I/O
                     requests that were issued to the device. Warning! Do  not
                     trust this field any more.  This field will be removed in
                     a future sysstat version.

              %util
                     Percentage of elapsed time during which I/O requests were
                     issued  to  the  device  (bandwidth  utilization  for the
                     device). Device saturation  occurs  when  this  value  is
                     close to 100% for devices serving requests serially.  But
                     for devices serving requests in parallel,  such  as  RAID
                     arrays  and  modern  SSDs,  this  number does not reflect
                     their performance limits.

OPTIONS
       -c     Display the CPU utilization report.

       -d     Display the device utilization report.

       -g group_name { device [...] | ALL }
              Display statistics for a group of devices.  The  iostat  command
              reports statistics for each individual device in the list then a
              line of global statistics for the group displayed as  group_name
              and  made  up  of  all  the devices in the list. The ALL keyword
              means that all the block devices defined by the system shall  be
              included in the group.

       -h     Make the Device Utilization Report easier to read by a human.

       -j { ID | LABEL | PATH | UUID | ... } [ device [...] | ALL ]
              Display persistent device names. Options ID, LABEL, etc. specify
              the type of the persistent name. These options are not  limited,
              only  prerequisite  is  that  directory with required persistent
              names is present in /dev/disk.  Optionally, multiple devices can
              be  specified  in the chosen persistent name type.  Because per-
              sistent device names are usually long, option

       -H     This option must be used with option -g and indicates that  only
              global  statistics  for  the  group are to be displayed, and not
              statistics for individual devices in the group.  -h  is  enabled
              implicitly with this option.

       -k     Display statistics in kilobytes per second.

       -m     Display statistics in megabytes per second.

       -N     Display the registered device mapper names for any device mapper
              devices.  Useful for viewing LVM2 statistics.

       -p [ { device [,...] | ALL } ]
              The -p option displays statistics  for  block  devices  and  all
              their  partitions that are used by the system.  If a device name
              is entered on the command line, then statistics for it  and  all
              its  partitions  are  displayed. Last, the ALL keyword indicates
              that statistics have to be displayed for all the  block  devices
              and  partitions defined by the system, including those that have
              never been used. If option -j is  defined  before  this  option,
              devices  entered  on  the command line can be specified with the
              chosen persistent name type.

       -t     Print the time for each report displayed. The  timestamp  format
              may  depend  on the value of the S_TIME_FORMAT environment vari-
              able (see below).

       -V     Print version number then exit.

       -x     Display extended statistics.

       -y     Omit first report with statistics since system boot, if display-
              ing multiple records at given interval.

       -z     Tell  iostat  to omit output for any devices for which there was
              no activity during the sample period.


ENVIRONMENT
       The iostat command takes into account the following  environment  vari-
       ables:


       POSIXLY_CORRECT
              When  this variable is set, transfer rates are shown in 512-byte
              blocks instead of the default 1K blocks.


       S_COLORS
              When this variable is set, display statistics in  color  on  the
              terminal.   Possible  values for this variable are never, always
              or auto (the latter is the default).

              Please note that the color (being red,  yellow,  or  some  other
              color)  used to display a value is not indicative of any kind of
              issue simply because of the color. It only  indicates  different
              ranges of values.


       S_COLORS_SGR
              Specify  the colors and other attributes used to display statis-
              tics on the terminal.  Its value is a  colon-separated  list  of
              capabilities             that             defaults            to
              H=31;1:I=32;22:M=34;1:N=33;1:Z=33;22.   Supported   capabilities
              are:


              H=     SGR  (Select  Graphic Rendition) substring for percentage
                     values greater than or equal to 75%.


              I=     SGR substring for device names.


              M=     SGR substring for percentage values in the range from 50%
                     to 75%.


              N=     SGR substring for non-zero statistics values.


              Z=     SGR substring for zero values.


       S_TIME_FORMAT
              If  this  variable  exists and its value is ISO then the current
              locale will be ignored when printing  the  date  in  the  report
              header.  The  iostat command will use the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-
              MM-DD) instead.  The timestamp displayed  with  option  -t  will
              also be compliant with ISO 8601 format.


EXAMPLES
       iostat
              Display  a  single  history  since  boot  report for all CPU and
              Devices.

       iostat -d 2
              Display a continuous device report at two second intervals.

       iostat -d 2 6
              Display six reports at two second intervals for all devices.

       iostat -x sda sdb 2 6
              Display six reports of extended statistics at two second  inter-
              vals for devices sda and sdb.

       iostat -p sda 2 6
              Display  six  reports at two second intervals for device sda and
              all its partitions (sda1, etc.)

BUGS
       /proc filesystem must be mounted for iostat to work.

       Kernels older than 2.6.x are no longer supported.

       The average service time (svctm field) value  is  meaningless,  as  I/O
       statistics  are  now  calculated at block level, and we don't know when
       the disk driver starts to process a  request.  For  this  reason,  this
       field will be removed in a future sysstat version.

    Description:
    		The /proc/diskstats file displays the I/O statistics
    		of block devices. Each line contains the following 14
    		fields:
    		 1 - major number
    		 2 - minor mumber
    		 3 - device name
    		 4 - reads completed successfully
    		 5 - reads merged
    		 6 - sectors read
    		 7 - time spent reading (ms)
    		 8 - writes completed
    		 9 - writes merged
    		10 - sectors written
    		11 - time spent writing (ms)
    		12 - I/Os currently in progress
    		13 - time spent doing I/Os (ms)
    		14 - weighted time spent doing I/Os (ms)

    主设备号   设备号  设备名称  读完成次数 合并读完成次数  读扇区的次数 读花费的毫秒数 写完成次数 合并写完成次数  写扇区次数  写操作花费的毫秒数 正在处理的输入/输出请求数 输入/输出操作花费的毫秒数 输入/输出操作花费的加权毫秒数

     第1个域：读完成次数 ----- 读磁盘的次数，成功完成读的总次数。
    （number of issued reads. This is the total number of reads completed successfully.）
     
    第2个域：合并读完成次数， 第6个域：合并写完成次数。为了效率可能会合并相邻的读和写。从而两次4K的读在它最终被处理到磁盘上之前可能会变成一次8K的读，才被计数（和排队），因此只有一次I/O操作。这个域使你知道这样的操作有多频繁。
    （number of reads merged）
     
    第3个域：读扇区的次数，成功读过的扇区总次数。
    （number of sectors read. This is the total number of sectors read successfully.）
     
    第4个域：读花费的毫秒数，这是所有读操作所花费的毫秒数（用__make_request()到end_that_request_last()测量）。
    （number of milliseconds spent reading. This is the total number of milliseconds spent by all reads (as measured from __make_request() to end_that_request_last()).）
     
    第5个域：写完成次数 ----写完成的次数，成功写完成的总次数。
    （number of writes completed. This is the total number of writes completed successfully.）
     
    第6个域：合并写完成次数 -----合并写次数。
    （number of writes merged Reads and writes which are adjacent to each other may be merged for efficiency. Thus two 4K reads may become one 8K read before it is ultimately handed to the disk, and so it will be counted (and queued) as only one I/O. This field lets you know how often this was done.）
     
    第7个域：写扇区次数 ---- 写扇区的次数，成功写扇区总次数。
    （number of sectors written. This is the total number of sectors written successfully.）
     
    第8个域：写操作花费的毫秒数  ---  写花费的毫秒数，这是所有写操作所花费的毫秒数（用__make_request()到end_that_request_last()测量）。
    （number of milliseconds spent writing This is the total number of milliseconds spent by all writes (as measured from __make_request() to end_that_request_last()).）
     
    第9个域：正在处理的输入/输出请求数 -- -I/O的当前进度，只有这个域应该是0。当请求被交给适当的request_queue_t时增加和请求完成时减小。
    （number of I/Os currently in progress. The only field that should go to zero. Incremented as requests are given to appropriate request_queue_t and decremented as they finish.）
     
    第10个域：输入/输出操作花费的毫秒数  ----花在I/O操作上的毫秒数，这个域会增长只要field 9不为0。
    （number of milliseconds spent doing I/Os. This field is increased so long as field 9 is nonzero.）
     
    第11个域：输入/输出操作花费的加权毫秒数 -----  加权， 花在I/O操作上的毫秒数，在每次I/O开始，I/O结束，I/O合并时这个域都会增加。这可以给I/O完成时间和存储那些可以累积的提供一个便利的测量标准。
    （number of milliseconds spent doing I/Os. This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O completion, I/O merge, or read of these stats by the number of I/Os in progress (field 9) times the number of milliseconds spent doing I/O since the last update of this field. This can provide an easy measure of both I/O completion time and the backlog that may be accumulating.）
